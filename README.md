# Pooblet

A simple service for finding pubs near a specific location, powered by OpenStreetMap https://www.openstreetmap.org/about

This is a personal project that is currently a work in progress (i keep forgetting it exists lol)

This is a sort of v2 to a similar and less ambitious project that instead uses the google places api (https://github.com/jamieyoung5/pub-roulette-backend)
Both projects are intended to serve a web app, from which the old iteration can still be found at https://pubroulette-b37b7.web.app/,
although the places key has probably expired by now (main domain is https://pubroulette.com/ which isnt linked to the web apps
deployment right now)
